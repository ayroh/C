&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 9

    1901042643.c => 1.Returns the number of paths Player could take back to the origin from the specified starting position,
                      subject to the condition that Player doesn’t want to take any unnecessary steps and can therefore only
                      move west or south (left or down in the diagram).
                    2.Function that accepts as input the set of all cities and a list of the cities that would be covered by each
                      hospital,along with the maximum number of hospitals that can be constructed, and returns whether or not it is
                      possible to provide coverage to all cities using the limited number of hospitals. If so, function would update
                      the result parameter to contain one such choice of hospitals

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 10
      
    1901042643.c => 2D Objects: There are three kinds of geometric objects.
                      Point: A point is defined by its two coordinates and a name.
                      Line: A line is defined by two points and a name.
                      Polygons: A circularly connected set of lines with at most 20 components.
                                It can be defined either by connecting a set of points or a set of lines.
                    
                    Actions: The following actions can be defined over the 2D objects provided in the data part of the file.
                      Distance: Print the distance between two points.
                      Distance: Print the distance between a point and a line.
                      Angle: Print the angle (in degrees) between two lines.
                      Length: Print the length of a given line. 
                      Length: Print the length (circumference) of a given polygon.
                      Area: Print the area of a given polygon.
                      
&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 11

    1901042643.c => Part 1: The program reads a text file named ‘list.txt’. This file contains a great number of comma
                            seperated random positive integers. The program should read this file only once and store 
                            these numbers in the given order. Find stats(speed) about min,max,mean and standard deviation of
                            these numbers for both linked list or array.
                    
                    Part 2: Write a function that takes two arguments holding a large number of integers. The first argument
                            is an array allocated from the heap, and the second is a linked list. It is assumed that these
                            two arguments are holding the same sequence of integers. However, for some reason, a few of the
                            entries are entered wrong. Your function will find the difference in the entries and return them
                            in a separate array
